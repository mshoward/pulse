###Examples

---

Examples in these folders will be included with their respective binaries, along with instructions on how to make them work.
  However, due to time and implementation constraints, only the main.cpp source file and relevent source files will be included.
  Their associated binaries will be included, however, due to the complex nature of the project, compilation of those sources
  should not be expected, they are included only as an aid in understanding how the API's and libraries work.
