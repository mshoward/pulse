- [X] Socket Interface module
- [X] Set up examples folder
- [X] Doxygen wizard documentation

####Current Focuses

- MYSQL Interface module
  - I have no idea yet
- Scheduler
  - inclusion of databucket into scheduler
- DataBucket module
  - caches
- Structures module *unfinished, but close to finished - needs to be uniform with database*
  - question class
  - response class
  - demographic class
  - guid class
  - user class


####Bugfixes:

- Fixed output to only return one line at a time, rather than multiple lines at a time.
  - fixed bug where it could *randomly* eat a character of a line, and not spit it up like it's supposed to
